There are some known issues:
* Amazon Drive: Due to unclear Amazon Policy this Provider may stop working at any time. Please do not rely on this functionality!
* Dropbox: Registering a Dropbox account on Windows 7 opens the default browser at the end of the registration process. This window/tab could be ignored/closed. See details in [#13](https://github.com/Kyrodan/KeeAnywhere/issues/13)
* KpScript is not supported, because it does not support plugins. See details in [#66](https://github.com/Kyrodan/KeeAnywhere/issues/66)
