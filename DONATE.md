# Donate - Your contribution to support KeeAnywhere

If you like KeeAnywhere, why not spend me a beer? Or just drop me line and say "Thank you, I like your work"? 
This is something you might do if we meet in real life. In anonymous internet where everything is for free,
it got uncommon to appreciate someones work in such a simple way. 

I do not want to earn money with KeeAnywhere. And I continue to provide KeeAnywhere for free.
But it would give me a great pleasure to welcome your tribute.

Here are some ways how you could donate - if your preferred option is not included, please drop me a line.
