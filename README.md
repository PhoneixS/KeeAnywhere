# Prerequisites

# Known noteworthy issues
* Amazon Drive: The support for Amazon Drive is completely implemented and tested. But I'm not allowed to release this because Amazon denied the App Approval Request.
* Dropbox: Registering a Dropbox account on Windows 7 opens the default browser at the end of the registration process. This window/tab could be ignored/closed.
